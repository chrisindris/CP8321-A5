## Assignment Description

Due Date: NOV 8, 2022 \
Deliverable Length: as needed \
Type: Individual Project \
Submission Format: pdf file 

This assignment is based on the discussion re mathematics of BackPropagation Learning From point view of algorithm and coding that was studied and discussed in length in our last lecture. \
In this assignment, we are writing a code to visualize the process of learning (feedforward to calculate output, Error calculation, backpropagation through the output to change weights and repeat). 
 - You can write your own backpropagation code and then do the coding to visualize the learning process. \
OR 
- You can use any software tool of your choice for the backpropagation and only do the coding for the visualization process.
